		<h1>Welcome to this alittle about me website.</h1>

        <p>My interests, skills, and career goals consist of working on cars, playing sports, and getting promoted.</p>

        <ul>
			<li>Working on cars is something I enjoy as a hobby because of that feeling I get when I fix an issue with my car that would've otherwise costed me hundreds to have repaired by a professional.
            </li>
			<li>Playing multiple sports is a skillset I just enjoy mostly as  another hobby.</li>
			<li>Getting promoted with the company I work for is a goal, since I love the company I work for because of the environemnt.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Above is a photo of a Subaru EJ257 which is the horizontal 4 cylinder platform. This engine has a stigma within the car community as being one of the most unreliable engines when generating a lot of power. Even with that stigma being mostly true in my opinion, the joy I get from the performance of this engine or car outweighs everything else.</p>
